Immune-Profiling:

We used the Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-Counter) method from the R package immunedeconv (PMID: 31510660) to deconvolute the tumor microenvironment of 123 Medulloblastoma RNA-seq samples consisting of four molecular subtypes i.e. Group3 (n = 15), WNT (n = 11), Group4 (n = 67) and SHH (n = 30). MCP-Counter represents cell type enrichment as abundance scores that are correlated to actual cell type proportions. MCP-Counter is based on the framework of transcriptomic markers (TM) and uses a ssGSEA like approach by finding enrichment of highly specific signature genes of each cell type within each input sample (PMID: 27765066). The advantage of using these scores is that they can be used to do inter-sample, intra-sample (between cell types) and inter-histology comparisons. MCP-Counter was also shown to perform best in a benchmarking study showing correlation between estimated immune cell types and flow cyotometry fractions. (PMID: 31641033)

To visualize the subtype specific enrichment, we created a heatmap of average immune scores per cell type across each molecular subtype. The SHH group was found to be enriched in B-cell, T-cell, Macrophage and Monocyte, Group 4 was enriched in Neutrophils and WNT was enriched in NK cells. We couldn't identify any cell type enrichment in Group 3 samples.
